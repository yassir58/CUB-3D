# CUB-3D
Cub-3d raycasting project:

Intorduction:
Ray-casting sensation began with the release of a game, Wolfenstein 3D (iD Software), in 1992 .
In Wolfenstein 3D, the player is placed on a three dimensional maze-like environment, where he/she must find an exit while battling multiple opponents.
Wolfenstein 3D becomes an instant classic for its fast and smooth animation. 
What enables this kind of animation is an innovative approach to three dimensional rendering known as “ray-casting.”

Wolfenstein 3D was developed and created by Id Software. 
Henceforth, Id’s programmer, John Carmack, might well be the person who initiates the ray-casting sensation (Myers 5).
WHAT IS RAY-CASTING?

Ray-casting is a technique that transform a limited form of data (a very simplified map or floor plan) into a 3D projection by tracing rays from the view point into the viewing volume (LaMothe 942).

Goals:
This project object is to improve our skills in game development we will be learning how to work with windows, colors, events, and fill shapes.
We will be building a game that is similar to the Wolfenstein 3D or Doom II
